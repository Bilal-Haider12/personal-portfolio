                </h2>
                <div class="blogitems">
                    <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
                    <p>My interest in web development started during my University years when I stumbled upon HTML and
                        CSS. Creating simple web pages and seeing them come to life in a browser was a thrilling
                        experience. I spent countless hours experimenting with different styles and layouts, which laid
                        the foundation for my future endeavors</p>

                    <h2>Diving Deeper: Learning JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>As I progressed, I realized that HTML and CSS were just the beginning. To create dynamic and
                        interactive websites, I needed to learn JavaScript. I started with online courses and tutorials,
                        which provided a solid introduction to the language. JavaScript opened up a new world of
                        possibilities, allowing me to add functionality and interactivity to my web projects.</p>

                    <h2>Embracing Full-Stack Development</h2>
                    <p>While front-end development was exciting, I soon discovered the importance of back-end
                        development. Learning server-side technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and databases like
                        MongoDB and MySQL allowed me to build complete web applications. Understanding both the
                        front-end and back-end gave me the ability to handle entire projects, from concept to
                        deployment.</p>

                    <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
                    <p>The journey to becoming a full-stack developer wasn't without challenges. There were times when I
                        felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information and the fast-paced nature of the tech
                        industry. However, perseverance and a structured learning approach helped me stay on track.
                        Joining online communities and attending local meetups also provided support and inspiration.
